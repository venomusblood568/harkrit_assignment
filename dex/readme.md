# DEX

Dex typically refers to a decentralized exchange, which is a type of cryptocurrency exchange that operates without a central authority or intermediary. Instead of relying on a centralized entity to facilitate trades, decentralized exchanges allow users to trade cryptocurrencies directly with each other in a peer-to-peer manner, often through smart contracts on a blockchain platform like Ethereum.
